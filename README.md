## **Using Python to Explore US Bikeshare Data**

### Requirements
The Python script was created using Python 3.7, which can be installed with the Anaconda installer [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows).

### Description
I created this Python script to explore data related to bicycle-sharing systems for three cities - Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  This was a project for the Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree (PDSND).

The code uses randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bikeshare system provider for many major cities in the United States.  All three of the csv datasets contain the same six core columns:

* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type

The Chicago and New York City datasets also contain the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

The code computes and displays the following statistics, based on raw input from the user:

###### Popular times of travel

* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

###### Popular stations and trip

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common hour of day

###### Popular stations and trip

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

###### Trip duration

* total travel time
* average travel time

###### User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
